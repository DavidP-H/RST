   <p>Computer graphics are used show the user what is happening, in more recent times, advancements have been made to better suit 3D rendering and video games. If you have ever been in the market for a gaming PC, you no doubt will have heard of the talk of graphics cards. These are cards that connect to the PCI-e slots on your computer, and have a chip in them called the GPU, or graphics processing unit. <br><br>Similar to the CPU, these chips have cores, however a modern day GPU will have thousands of cores, in comparison to a CPUs 2-8 (under most circumstances). However the GPU cores are much more simple, handling floating point operations, but not much else. In comparison to the CPU cores, which can be programmed to do almost anything, the GPU cores are very simple. You can think of this as the GPU being very fast, but not smart, and the CPU very smart, but not fast.</p>
