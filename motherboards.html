   <p>Motherboards (sometimes referred to as mainboards) are the part of your computer that connects everything together, they have lots of plugs, slots and ports to connect a wide range of accessories to your computer, the most common being the PCI-e (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slot. This slot can be used to connect things like graphics cards, wireless cards, or other add on cards.</p>

   <h2>Sizes</h2>
   <p>Motherboards come in three common sizes. These sizes are as follows:<br><br>ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended)<br>mATX (microATX)<br>Mini ITX(Information Technology eXtended)</p>
   <br>
   <p>These are the standard sizes you are most likely to find in stores when shopping for motherboards. It is important to keep these sizes in mind when you are shopping for cases, as certain cases only fit ITX or mATX boards, however if you have a case that fits an ATX board it should also fit a mATX board. ITX cases are usually more specialized becase of their small size to not waste any space.</p>
