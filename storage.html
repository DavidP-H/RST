   <h1>Storage</h1>
   <p>Storage is the long-term memory of the computer. Nowadays there are two types of storage used, Hard Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs).</p>
   <h2>Hard Drives</h2>
   <p>A hard drive is a form of magnetic mechanical storage, used to store large files such as the operating system, applications and any other files the user needs to store. Now slowly being replaced by Solid-State Drives because of their improved speed, the hard drive is still used alongside solid-state drives for large files because of lower cost for larger sizes, as well as slightly better reliability.</p>

   <h3>Solid-State Drives</h3>
   <p>In recent times, it has become increasingly popular to use Solid-State Drives in collaboration with traditional hard drives, the solid state drive containing a users operating system and frequently used applications (such as a web browser) and hard drives are used to store big files (such as video games or videos and pictures.)</p>
   <img style="width: 20%;" class="img-center" src="/images/M.2.jpg" alt="M.2 SSD">
   <p style="font-size: 75%;">Pictured above is an M.2 SSD, which is functionally the same (but perhaps a bit faster depending on other specifications)<br> as a traditional SSD (pictured below), but comes in a small form factor. Widely used on laptops because of this reason.</p>
   <br>
   <img style="width: 20%;" class="img-center" src="/images/SSD.jpg" alt="Sata SSD">
   <p style="font-size: 75%;">This is a more traditional SSD. It uses a SATA connector to connect to the motherboard (just like a hard drive).
