   <h1>Power Supplies</h1>
   <p>The power supply is responsible for taking power from the outlet in the wall and turning it into something useable for the computer. It converts A/C power into D/C power as well as providing stable current to all parts of the computer, which is very important to prevent damage.<br><br>Power supplies have two main measurements, the wattage and the efficiency rating. A standard power supply is rated for around 500 watts.<br><br>Efficiency is measured using the 80+ standard. An 80+ power supply must be at least 80% efficient under 20%, 50%, and 100% load. After that, there are many other classifications 80+ bronze, silver, gold, platinum and titanium, which each improves on the efficiency by a few percent.<br><br>There are also different modularities, such as non-modular (where the cables are hard-wired into the power supply) semi-modular (where only the cables that are absolutely necessary (such as the motherboard 24pin and CPU connector) are hard-wired) and the rest (SATA power, PCI-e, etc.) are not hard-wired and can instead be unplugged if not being used, which helps with cable management.</p>
