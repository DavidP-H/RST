   <h1>Cooling</h1>
   <p>In this guide, we will cover cooling and cases together, as they help one another.</p>
   <h2>CPU Cooling</h2>
   <p>Typically, there are two types of cooling that the average person may consider, air cooling or water cooling.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 75%;">CPU Air Cooler</p>
   <p>Air cooling is (under most circumstances) the more reliable of the two options, as there is no way for fluid to evaporate or leak.</p>

   <img style="width: 20%;" class="img-right" src="/images/customLoop.jpg" alt="Custom Water Cooled Loop">
   <p>There are two types of water cooling, all-in-one water coolers (or AIOs) (left) and custom water cooling. (right) As the names might suggest, AIOs are easier to set up and require less matinence as they are sealed in a factory, that being said, custom water cooling will most likely provide better cooling performance, at the added cost of maintenance, setup difficulty, and price.</p>

   <h3>Cases</h3>
   <p>Cases are basically the metal box that goes around your PC and holds everything in place, but there different sizes, so make sure that when you pick a case that you think about the size of your motherboard. These sizes are discussed on the <a href="motherboards.html">motherboard</a> page.</p>
