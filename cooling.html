   <h1>Cooling</h1>
   <p>In this guide, we will cover cooling and cases together, as they help one another.</p>
   <h2>CPU Cooling</h2>
   <p>Typically, there are two types of cooling that the average person may consider, air cooling or water cooling.<br><br>Air cooling is (under most circumstances) the more reliable of the two options, as there is no way for fluid to evaporate or leak.<br><br>There are two types of water cooling, all-in-one water coolers (or AIOs) and custom water cooling. As the names might suggest, AIOs are easier to set up and require less matinence as they are sealed in a factory, that being said, custom water cooling will most likely provide better cooling performance, at the added cost of maintenance and price.</p>
   <h3>Cases</h3>
   <p>Cases are basically the metal box that goes around your PC and holds everything in place, but there different sizes, so make sure that when you pick a case that you think about the size of your motherboard. These sizes are discussed on the <a href="motherboards.html">motherboard</a> page.</p>
